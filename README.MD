## 1. Attendance & CGPA Predictor
* **Description:** Predicts a student's next semester attendance by analyzing their past attendance and CGPA records.
* **Run it:** [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Suubbbhhash/MODELS/blob/main/ATTENDANCE_PREDICTION_MODEL.ipynb)

## 2. Screen Time Advisor
* **Description:** Takes 7 days of screen time to predict future expected usage and recommend a healthy daily limit.
* **Run it:** [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Suubbbhhash/MODELS/blob/main/HEALTHY_SCREENTIME_MODEL.ipynb)

## 3. Disease Diagnosis Helper
* **Description:** Takes a list of symptoms and predicts the most likely disease with a percentage probability.
* **Run it:** [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Suubbbhhash/MODELS/blob/main/DISEASE_DIAGNOSIS_MODEL.ipynb)

## 4. Workout & Diet Recommender
* **Description:** Takes yesterday's calorie intake and suggests a workout type, duration, and foods to avoid.
* **Run it:** [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Suubbbhhash/MODELS/blob/main/CALORIE_AND_WORKOUT_MODEL.ipynb)
